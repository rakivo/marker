## SOFTWARE IS NOT FINISED!

#### Embrace the power of backticks! Placing \` at both ends of your input line turns the remainder into a code snippet. 
#### For instance, typing \`for instance\` results in formatted code. 
#### Additionally, unleash the heading magic by using \# followed by a number to specify the heading level.
#### For example, #4 translates into \#\#\#\#. A single \#, on its own, transforms into a solitary hashtag. Get ready to elevate your markdown writing experience!

### Usage:
```shell
$ cd marker && cargo run --release
$ #6 Code: hello world 
$ \` # to enter multi line code mode
$ println!("hello, world");
$ \` # once again to exit the mode
$ q # to quit and save this to test.md file
```

### the Marker will interpret that to this:
###### Code: hello world
```
println!("hello, world");
```

### The essence of this entire project revolves around crafting a tool that enables faster markdown file creation through the use of intuitive hotkeys and other innovative features.
